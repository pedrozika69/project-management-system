### **Project Description: Project Management System**

This project is part of the **Trends in Technology** course that I lectured in 2025 at **Lasalle College in Montreal**. It was designed as a hands-on activity to introduce students to modern software development practices, tools, and collaboration techniques. Over the course of the semester, students actively contributed to the development of this project, which eventually became their final project. The goal was to provide a real-world experience in building a full-stack application, from planning to deployment.

The **Project Management System** is a web application that allows users to manage their projects, tasks, and team collaborations efficiently. It was built using a **Svelte** frontend and a **.NET Core** backend, with **PostgreSQL** as the production database and **SQLite** for development. The application was containerized using **Docker Compose** for seamless deployment and scalability.

### **Project Overview**

#### **Frontend: Svelte**
The frontend of the application is built using **Svelte**, a modern JavaScript framework known for its simplicity and performance. Svelte was chosen for its ability to compile components into highly efficient, imperative code that directly manipulates the DOM. Key features of the frontend include:
- **Project and Task Management**: Users can create, update, delete, and view projects and tasks.
- **Team Collaboration**: Users can assign tasks to team members and track progress.
- **Filtering and Sorting**: Tasks and projects can be filtered by status, priority, and due date.
- **User Authentication**: A secure login and registration system ensures that only authorized users can access the application.
- **Responsive Design**: The application is fully responsive, providing a seamless experience across devices.

#### **Backend: .NET Core**
The backend is built using **.NET Core**, a cross-platform framework for building modern, high-performance web applications. The backend provides a RESTful API that the frontend interacts with. Key features include:
- **JWT Authentication**: Secure user authentication and authorization using JSON Web Tokens (JWT).
- **Role-Based Access Control**: Different user roles (e.g., Admin, Manager, User) have access to specific features.
- **CRUD Operations**: Full support for creating, reading, updating, and deleting projects, tasks, and team assignments.
- **Database Integration**: Seamless integration with **PostgreSQL** for production and **SQLite** for development.

#### **Database**
- **Production**: **PostgreSQL** is used as the primary database for its robustness, scalability, and support for advanced features like transactions and indexing.
- **Development**: **SQLite** is used during development for its simplicity and ease of setup.

#### **Deployment: Docker Compose**
The application is deployed using **Docker Compose**, which simplifies the process of managing multiple services (API, App, and DB) in a production environment. The `docker-compose.yml` file defines the services and their configurations, ensuring consistency across environments.

### **Collaboration and Learning Outcomes**
This project was a collaborative effort among students, providing them with hands-on experience in:
- **Agile Development**: Students worked in sprints, using tools like GitHub Projects to manage tasks and track progress.
- **Full-Stack Development**: Students gained experience in both frontend (Svelte) and backend (.NET Core) development.
- **Database Management**: Students learned to work with relational databases (PostgreSQL and SQLite) and integrate them with the backend.
- **DevOps Practices**: Students were introduced to containerization and deployment using Docker Compose.
- **Team Collaboration**: Students collaborated on GitHub, using pull requests, code reviews, and issue tracking to manage the project.

### **Conclusion**
The **Project Management System** project was a valuable learning experience for the students, allowing them to apply theoretical knowledge to a real-world application. By the end of the course, students had not only built a functional application but also gained practical skills in modern software development practices. This project exemplifies the importance of collaboration, continuous learning, and adaptability in the ever-evolving field of technology.
